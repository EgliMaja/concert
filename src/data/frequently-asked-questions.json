Culture Ticket will spare no effort to cancel the order by contacting the respective event organizer. We will try to reach a compromise in order to achieve an entire or partial reimbursement in cash or the form of a coupon for you.\nIf the cancellation is rejected by the organizers, we offer you the possibility to take your already booked tickets on commission up to 2 weeks before the event. They will then be offered on our website. In case your tickets are successfully sold, you will receive 50% of the ticket price refunded. If the tickets are not sold, you can of course still redeem them by yourself."

It is at the discretion of the organizer to decide whether tickets can be returned, refunded or exchanged.\nPerformances are subject to changes of cast, date and/or programme. In any case, these changes will not establish any claims in terms of cash refunds, price reductions or the return of tickets. Should an event be canceled, postponed or relocated, Culture Ticket guarantees you its full support for the cancellation process."
